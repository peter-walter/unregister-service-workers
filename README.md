# unregistersw

Disables all registered service workers in the current browser session.

## Description

If service workers are not supported, a warning is logged to the console.  
Errors during the process are caught and logged.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```sh
npm install unregister-service-workers
```

## Returns

`Promise<void>` â€“ A promise that resolves once all service workers have been unregistered.

## Usage

// Call this function to disable all service workers in the current browser session.
